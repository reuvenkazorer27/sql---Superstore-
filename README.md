# Superstore Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a Superstore dataset, performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The goal of this project is to extract insights from the dataset, including sales trends, profit analysis, and performance by category, segment, and more. This analysis aims to help businesses understand the key metrics that drive profitability and sales, which can inform better decision-making.

## Overview

In this project, I have analyzed various aspects of the Superstore dataset. Key insights and visualizations are generated using SQL queries, pandas, and matplotlib. The analysis covers:
- Sales trends by year, month, and region.
- Profit breakdowns by category, subcategory, and segment.
- Performance comparisons between different sales channels, shipping modes, and cities.
- Detailed analysis of discounts and their impact on sales and profits.

The analysis also includes forecasted values for specific metrics, providing insights for future performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is a publicly available Superstore dataset that includes information about sales, profits, product categories, subcategories, order dates, ship dates, and more.

The dataset features the following columns:
- `Order Date`: Date when the order was placed.
- `Ship Date`: Date when the order was shipped.
- `Sales`: Sales revenue for the order.
- `Profit`: Profit from the order.
- `Category`: Product category (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies).
- `Sub-Category`: Subcategory within each product category.
- `City`: City of the customer.
- `Segment`: Customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).

## Analysis

### Sales by Year
The project provides an analysis of total sales for each year in the dataset. The year-over-year performance is displayed, highlighting trends and patterns over time.

### Sales by Category
Sales data is aggregated and analyzed by product categories. The top categories are determined by total sales, and insights into their performance are provided.

### Profit Analysis
Profitability is assessed at both the category and subcategory levels. The project calculates the total profit and profit percentage for each category and subcategory.

### Subcategory Performance
For each category, we drill down into the performance of individual subcategories. The top-performing subcategories are listed, with a focus on profit generation.

### Discount Analysis
The impact of discounts on sales and profit is analyzed by segment and category. The relationship between discount percentages and profitability is explored.
